# Casino Project

The JavaFX Casino was a 3 week school project created by randomly selected group over 3 classes. I was responsible for the database connection to our MySQL database, the sign in / up and the general UI / UX of the casino. Additinally each group member had to design and program a game, I choose the game Sic Bo.

* To open the whole project use any IDE that supports Maven & JavaFX.

* In order to get the program running you need to create a database and  
then edit the database credentails in DBConfig.java. An SQL Script to   
easily import the database table structures will be included soon.
